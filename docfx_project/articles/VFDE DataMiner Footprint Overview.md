# Overview

Vodafone is hosting the entire footprint in a virtualized environment. This means that all nodes (DataMiner, Cassandra & Elasticsearch) are running on VM guest images.
There are currently 3 different datacenter sites (Frankfurt, Kerpen & Munich ) but Munich is actively being decommissioned with end of 2023 as due date.
We've already completed migrating the DataMiner footprint from Munich to Kerpen. This leaves only a subset of the equipment under monitoring still at the datacenter in Munich.
All DataMiner footprint related nodes are currently hosted both Frankfurt and Kerpen datacenters.


# Georedundancy

The Frankfurt and Kerpen datacenters are configured in such a way that they provide georedundancy to the global infrastructure. Each individual datacenter also provides device level redundancy as well.
This means that a specific service signal typically flows twice in each datacenter. The end result of this is typically considered as quadrupal redundancy for a specific service signal flow.


# Production DMS Environment

The vodafone production environment currently exists out of 8 DataMiner nodes ( 4 in Frankfurt DC & 4 in Kerpen DC) which together form the operational production cluster.
It's configured to have one local database per cluster and has Search and Indexing enabled as well as an active DataMiner Cloud connection.

## DataMiner Cluster Nodes

8 production DataMiner agents, 4 located in each datacenter, configured as one DataMiner cluster.
